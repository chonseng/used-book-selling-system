# Used Book Selling System
http://home.puiching.edu.mo/~pcmssa/book/

The Used Book Selling System is designed for sellers to list their books and buyers to find the books on sale easily. The system is currently used by Macau Pui Ching Middle School Student Association(SA). Students could bring their used books to school for sale. SA members would help the seller list the books and provide the seller a receipt with an ID, which could be used to track his/her books status online in real time.

## Home page
The home page lists all the books on sale. The list can be sorted by the price difference between new and used book, price and listed time.
